# Objective

In my first project. I wanted to develop a simple website that would be beneficial for any business to have. The main objective was to present my skills in HTMl and CSS.

# User Experience
## Design

The Design for Pizza Palace was built in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

### Home Page Plan

### Booking page

## Site Structure

The website for Pizza Palace is set over four webpages with three navigations links for the user to use. The **Home** page is the default loading page. The **Gallery** has all the sample images that the business might have. Finally the **Form** page where the user can show their interest. The fourth page is where you are directed when you complete the form.

## Design Choices
I wanted the colours of the Site to stand out, so making a simple pallette that represented the colours of pizza was the way I decided to go. Focusing on Red or crust colour fonts for all scripts works well together. I chose the font Quicksand for all titles. I think the font is clean and simple.

### Home

![Home Menu Page](assets/readmeimages/Pizzapalacehomescreen.png)

This is the first part of the website that the User will be visiting. I wanted to make the purpose immediately clear that this website was all about Pizza.
I added a catchy slogan front and center on the page so that the User understands that this website is about helping the Users step up their game making pizzas.
Attached to the slogan is a responsive button that encouages the user to "Book Now" Clicking the button will send them to the booking page where they can sign up.

### About
![About Us Section](/assets/readmeimages/aboutus.png)
The about section lets the user know about what time the classes are on, the mission statement for the business as a whole, as well as the location of where to find the classes.

### Gallery

![Gallery Page](/assets/readmeimages/gallery.png)

The gallery has a layout of stock photos that would give the user a sense of what the classes entail and the benefits that they would have.
I used 

### Booking Form

![Booking Form Page](/assets/readmeimages/bookingform.png)

I wanted the booking page to be straightforward. With a simple sign in sheet to display interest in the classes. Along with

### Footer

![Footer Image](assets/readmeimages/footer.png)

I wanted the footer to continue the clean layout along with the rest of the page. I didn't want any text, and only the simple icons of the social media to complete a clear and crisp look that is very intuitive.
